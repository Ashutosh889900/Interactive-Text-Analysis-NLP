It is easy to set up, easy to use, and I like the cloud option. However, one main flaw is motion detection. Interestingly the cam detects motion in some cases but misses in other cases. I don't know what the reason for that is. If you are 6-7 ft away, then it does not detect your motion at all. I wish they could improve its motion detection feature a bit more. Then it would be a great indoor camera.",0

Our first time using them was along the CA coast near San Simeon for an impromptu sunset dinner.  My husband has extremely wide shoulders and he fit wonderfully and comfortably in his chair, which held his weight nicely.  My chair was very comfortable for shorter periods of time; however, my legs are a bit short, so the front of the seat cut into my legs a bit with the chair on a hard-packed surface.  In sand on the beach, it will be just fine.  The extra storage in the left armrest is genius!  With a small frozen pack, it will likely hold 2-3 cans or 1-2 bottles, and it's insulated.  I would recommend wiping it out after use with a dry towel/cloth to avoid mold or mildew.  I would definitely buy these again.

So far it is keeping perfect time, though. The appearance is attractive and it feels ""solid."" Really quite good value for the price. My only mild criticisms center on the wristband. The leather strap is very stiff, not supple, so the watch doesn't rest snugly on my wrist and it can be difficult to bend the strap enough to slide it through the first loop, which is very close to the buckle. I don't know whether it will stay this way, get softer with use, or crack and break after a few months. If it does, then I would probably go ahead and invest in a new leather strap that felt better and went on & off easier.Some reviewers have complained about the tin box the watch comes in because it can look a bit ""banged up"" or used. But I think that's intentional. After all, the company is called Fossil, not ""Shiny Chrome!""",0

R1AKXAKI05ENRI,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020",Home and Kitchen,Furniture,"Amazon Basics Ergonomic Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Adjustable Height/Tilt, 360-Degree Swivel, 275Lb Capacity - Black",it won't maintain the same height,1.0,"item arrived fast, took me about 30 min to put together which isn't bad at all.  this is where the good stuff ends.  I bought the chair at the beginning of the Covid 19 outbreak in March, by June the chair's height adjustment has failed--it will let you adjust up but within a day it will completely bottom out.  to maintain your desired height you have to continuously adjust it through out the day.  With me having to focus on my monitor at least 8 hours a day i often don't realize what is happening until my back/neck pain is disrupting my focus.  I weight around 150 so unless this chair is intended for children it is not a weight issue.So, if you want a super low chair, this chair is good for the price.  otherwise, spend a few extra dollars to get a better chair.",1
