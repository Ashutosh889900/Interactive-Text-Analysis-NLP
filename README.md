# Interactive-Text-Analysis-NLP

An end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing and visualizing online product reviews. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and insightful visualizations to understand customer opinions and review patterns.

## Project Overview

Online product reviews contain valuable insights about customer satisfaction, preferences, and pain points.  
This project analyzes such reviews using NLP techniques and presents the findings through clear and meaningful visualizations, helping to understand overall customer sentiment and common feedback trends.

## Key Features

- Loaded and analyzed textual datasets such as online product reviews  
- Performed text preprocessing including:
  - Lowercasing  
  - Punctuation and special character removal  
  - Stopword removal  
- Applied NLP techniques to analyze customer opinions and review patterns  
- Conducted sentiment analysis to identify positive and negative feedback  
- Performed n-gram analysis to find frequently occurring word combinations  
- Generated word clouds and frequency plots for important terms  
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Extracted meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making  

## Visual Outputs

This project includes multiple visualizations such as:

- Word clouds  
- Word frequency plots  
- Sentiment distribution charts
