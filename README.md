# Interactive-Text-Analysis-NLP
An end-to-end NLP project focused on analyzing and visualizing online product reviews. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, and insightful visualizations to understand customer opinions and review patterns.

## Project Overview

Online product reviews contain valuable insights about customer satisfaction, preferences, and pain points. This project analyzes such reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and presents insights through clear and meaningful visualizations.

## Key Features

- Loaded and analyzed textual datasets such as online product reviews
- Performed text preprocessing including lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and special character cleaning
- Applied NLP techniques to analyze customer opinions and review patterns
- Conducted sentiment analysis to understand positive and negative feedback
- Performed n-gram analysis to identify frequently occurring word combinations
- Generated word clouds and frequency plots for key terms in reviews
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Extracted meaningful insights from customer reviews to support decision-making

## Visual Outputs

This project contains multiple visualizations such as word clouds, frequency plots, and sentiment distributions.

Note: GitHub may not properly render all notebook visual outputs.
